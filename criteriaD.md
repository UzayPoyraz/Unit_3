## Evaluation

### Overview

As seen from the chart, I have met almost all of the success criterias successfully. The program is not finished because there are still things that can be added and little tweeks that can be fixed. Overall I have a program in my hand that can finish the tasks that my client wanted from me. In my opinion the program is not very useful and all of these information can be stored in easier and more convinient ways but it helped me a lot learning python or object oriented programs in general.

### Future changes and improvements

I have had this section in the end section of all of the criteria processes but this is to sum it up. My final thoughts on inprovements are

1) I want to make the 'Revert Changes' work so that the user can revert to a certain database, it might be helpful.

2) Adding a search to the list can be very helpful finding spesific items. 

3) One thing that I wanted to do was having a better design. Right now the program looks plain and not interesting but maybe with some colors and couple of images here and there, the GUI can have a better look.

4) If I had more contact with my client I thing I could have developed a program that is more like the program my client has in his mind and also increase the database.

5) Last but not least I can implement a system where it shows the last time an eraser was used, maybe that can help my client in someway
