Today we started the lesson with a paper the teacher gave us. The paper showed examples about classes
and instances. Later on we went through one of the examples and learned multiple graphing techniques.
I am a bit confused about the last part of the code we did.


HOMEWORK: 
1) Finish OPP
2) Bring sketches to the app so we can put it in a designer program. (on paper)
