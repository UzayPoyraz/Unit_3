We are going to have two projects this term
1)First we learned what computational thinking is from a video. The proccess goes like decomposition, pattern recognition,
abstraction and algorithm design respectively
2) We warmed up by coding a program that finds the largest prime factor of the entered 10 inputs
3) We created a library where we stock important programing structures
In addition to all of this,
I will do Keitaro's program which will be a library for earasers.
