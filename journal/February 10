First we started with a warm-up
The exercize we had to do was find the distance between 2 cities (The point of the cities were given already)
Afterwards, we created a new md in our repository to easily show the design section of a program
Later on we started a roleplaying game where one is a client and other is a developer
The questions we asked were: "What types? "What properties do your objects have" "What program do you want your app to be?"
"What is wrong about the legacy system?"
What my client needs: Different brands, ingredients, colors, 
Simple and easy to use
