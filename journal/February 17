We started the lesson by seperating into 3 tables and having a competition about who can create a suggested program first without
laptops. After that we had a kahoot game about the parts of a computer. Later on, we started working on our success criteria for our
unit 3 project. Everyone made an initial draft about their success criteria and later presented it to their client for feedback. I got good
feedback so I didn't change my success criteria much. The interview with client was recorded and I made an appendix file to store information
like audio.
