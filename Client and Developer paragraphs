In my pencil case I have multiple pencils. At the moment I am struggling to pick what pencil I should use. In order to understand it
I need to know which pencil needs sharpening and when was the last time I used the pencil. Before all of this I need a data base so I can
differenciate pencils from each other. Some of the different properties that are enough to seperate these pencils are their brand,
color, if it has a soft earaser on the back and the lenght if it's short or long (anything that 8 cm or less is short). I want all of these
to be recorded and a system where it shows when I last used them and if they need sharpening. I would like an option to tick off the pencils
I have sharpened. Good luck, if there is anything you are struggling to understand email me.
