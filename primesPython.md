## Prime numbers (with Python)
### Explanation of the code:
The version 1 of the program starts by identifying the prime numbers. This is done by deviding ever integer from 2 to itself. If the remainder is 0, this means that the integer is False (not prime)
To sum it up, with just a few simple optimizations, there are dramatic improvement in the performence of the program. (From roughly 56
seconds to less then 0.2)
