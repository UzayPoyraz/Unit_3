### T - Technical - Is the project technically possible?
By the coding skills I aquired, the project is very much possible and I have sufficient knowledge to get it done.

### E - Economic - Can the project be afforded? Will it increase profit?
The project does not require any fees because I am planning on doing it from Python. Python is a free to use
programing language, hence, no direct money will be used. On the other note, it will not increase my profit because I am doing
it for free.

### L - Legal - Is the project legal?
The project is completely legal because the coding language I will use is licenced. I develope the program myself so all the rights
will be mine.

### O - Operational - How will the current operations support the change?

### S - Scheduling - Can the project be done in time?
If I put enough time on certain days to the program and have a good plan,
there is no reason for the program not to be done in time. Worse case senerio and I can't finish the program in an estimated time, I will
replan so I finish the program until the designated deadline.
