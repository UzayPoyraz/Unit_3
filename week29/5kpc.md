### I don't know the what I would specifically buy, there are lots of options but I will list what parts I need to buy witht their functions:

## Components

### Case:
The case is the outer layer of the PC. It usually does nothing more than protect the PC from potential physical damages. It is not very vital to have a quality case

### Motherboard
The motherboard is one of the most important compenents. It is a curcuit board that works like a central hub. Every other component will be attached to it and in order to operate properly, the motherboard should be flawless.

### CPU
CPU is also another very important component. Without it the computer will quite literally not work. The CPU calculates almost every process in the PC so having a fast CPU will make a significant difference. Additionally, the CPU should be compatible with the motherboard.

### CPU Cooler
The CPU can be cooled in two different ways. It can either be cooled by waterloop or air-cooled. The waterloop is usually used on more performance based computers because they get warm quicker and waterloop is a more efficient method of cooling a PC. Unfortuneately, the waterloop cooler is noisier than the air-cooled so it is based on preferance. For a fast CPU, waterloop is prefered.

### GPU

The GPU does calculations of anything that is displayed visually. There are two types of GPUs Integrated GPU and discrete GPU. The integrated GPU is the processor that comes with the CPU. This CPU is enough to display tasks on minimal performance. If you want higher performance, or do tasks that require better frames and proccessing power, you need to get a discrete CPU.

### Memory(RAM)
The RAM is a temporary storage that is lost when the PC is shut down. It can be thought as the temporary thinking storage. More gigabytes of RAM can improve performance but after a point, which is determined by the tasks you do on your PC and the compability of your PC, having more RAM will not change anything.

### Storage
There are two types of storages: HDD and the SDD. The only difference between these two are the speed of reading and writing. An HDD reads and saves a file at 100 mb/s speed and an SDD is 5 times faster than this. For better performance, an SDD can be picked.

### PSU
A power suply unit is the main source to power up your PC. For optimum efficieny, a power suply unit should be bought according to how many watts of energy the PC requires.

### Monitor
A monitor is the physical display of the computer. These displays have the term Hertz. The amount of hertz a monitor is the amount of frames it can display in a second. There are 3 popular hertz for a pc: 60Hz, 144Hz and 240hz. The best one is 240 Hz but there is no point of buying a 240 Hz monitor if the computer can not preform 240 frames per second.
