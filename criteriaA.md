Inside my desk drawer, I have a lot of non used erasers just sitting there. Recently, I've wanted to organize my desk and surroundings and these erasers literally took 70% of my time collecting it.
I am now struggling to organize information of each eraser. I need some database to list all of the characteristics of my collection and the details would be their Brand, Materials (PVC, PP etc..), used or unused and last but not least, is there still a usable corner left??
Compiling all of this information into one database would be very helpful. 

### Based on this information and a meeting with my client (The audio can be found in Appendix folder) My propsed solution is:
I will create a program that stored all of his erasers with all of the properties listed. These properties will be Brand, Material, used, unused and if used, is there a useable corner. The program will have an adding deleting and an editing function so that the client can do as they please. I will be using Python for this program since that is what we are learning right now and it is compatible with the designing application we are currently using. 

## Success Criteria
1) Making a program that the user can edit, delete and add
2) Seperating the erasers with the properties needed (Brand, Materials (PVC, PP etc..), used or unused and if there is still a usable corner left
3) Collecting all information into one database
4) The prints will be clearly understandable, hence, the instructions and context will be understandeable; making it more useable.
