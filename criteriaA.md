Inside my desk drawer, I have a lot of non used erasers just sitting there. Recently, I've wanted to organize my desk and surroundings and these erasers literally took 70% of my time collecting it.
I am now struggling to organize information of each eraser. I need some database to list all of the characteristics of my collection and the details would be their Brand, Materials (PVC, PP etc..), used or unused and last but not least, is there still a usable corner left??
Compiling all of this information into one database would be very helpful. 

### Based on this information and a meeting with my client (The audio can be found in Appendix folder):
## Success Criteria
1) Making a program that the user can edit, delete and add
2) Seperating the erasers with the properties needed (Brand, Materials (PVC, PP etc..), used or unused and if there is still a usable corner left
3) Collecting all information into one database
4) The prints will be clearly understandable, hence, the instructions and context will be understandeable; making it more useable.
